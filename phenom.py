    '''
    takes a world object representing the maximal amount of info available to a model and
    returns an object describing the input shape, output shape, etc of a neural network or any other
    general function that could act as the heart of a model
    '''

    return

'''

to do:

classes to formalize 'model shape', machine learning models, other parameterizable models
functions that take a model shape and return 
    more detailed specs for a keras model,
    some other kind of scheme for parameterizing the fn space 
        (i.e. a list of degrees of polynomials that could somehow comprise a trainable model)
